          HitTrax™ is the first and only baseball simulator. A powerful combination of analytics and entertainment that has never before been available to indoor facilities. Patented technology delivers innovation to the baseball industry by measuring real-time data and displaying live results for immediate feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          The HitTrax™ has several functions to help train your players.  It can accurately analyze the exit velocity of a baseball hit by your player, the launch angle of said baseball, and where the baseball traveled to.  It can also analyze exactly where a pitch is thrown and at what speed, and has functions to help train your catcher's release time and accuracy in throwing.  The HitTrax™ also has a gaming module in which teams can compete, as well as online ranking and tournaments.
